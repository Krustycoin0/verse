## üî• Features

- Decentralized identity + content distribution over [Ethereum](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/contracts)
- Open backend, anyone can run their own servers
- Custom multi-threaded, [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF)-based game engine
- [VRM](https://vrm.dev/) avatar support
- Visual editor for creating spaces

## üì¶ What's inside?

This [turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following apps / packages:

### Apps

- [client](apps/client): the main website used to access The Wired
- [docs](apps/docs): a documentation website
- [host](apps/host): dockerized server for hosting spaces

### Packages

- [contracts](packages/contracts): generated contract types
- [engine](packages/engine): a multi-threaded 3D game engine
- [eslint-config-custom](packages/eslint-config-custom): custom eslint config used throughout the repo
- [gltf-extensions](packages/gltf-extensions): glTF-Transform implementations of extensions used by the engine
- [protocol](packages/protocol): types describing the interface between client and host
- [react-client](packages/react-client): React components and hooks used by the client
- [tsconfig](packages/tsconfig): tsconfigs used throughout the repo

### Utilities

- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for package versioning
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking

## üêã Docker

The client can be run locally using Docker. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn docker:prod
```

This will start the client on port 3000. You can then access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To stop the client, run the following command:

```bash
yarn docker:stop
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

### Install

To install all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you run into issues installing, it's probably mediasoup. Follow the steps on their [installation guide](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/) to get it to work (pay attention to the versions very carefully). Mediasoup tends to be easier to install on Linux, so if you're on Windows, consider using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Develop

To work on the client, you will need to use Docker to run services it relies on (such as the database). To do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn docker:dev
```

If you don't need that, you can run all apps and packages in development mode using the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```
