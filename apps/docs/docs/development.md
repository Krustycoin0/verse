This guide aims to provide a unified development process for developers of "The Wired" open source project, ensuring its maintainability and scalability. The processes and steps outlined in this document are based on best practices and past experiences, but may also be modified and adjusted according to the specific needs of the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

‚öôÔ∏è Before starting development, make ensure that you have the following tools and environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher installed
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) api key
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/s3/) or [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)

üîß Update the environment variables:

:::warning

Keep your secrets safe, do not commit them to the repository. You can copy the `.env` file to `.env.local` and update the variables.

:::

```bash
# Copy .env.local file
pushd apps/client && cp .env .env.local && popd
```

ü™ö install dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

## üìù Branch Management

Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system, create `dev` branches and `main` branches. Developers work on `dev` branches and initiate merge requests to the main branch after completing tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Building

```bash
# Run the apps
docker:dev
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app, [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) to view the documentation.
