This guide aims to provide a unified development process for developers of The Wired, ensuring its maintainability and scalability. The processes and steps outlined in this document are based on best practices and past experiences, but may also be modified and adjusted according to the specific needs of your setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

### Step 1 - Install tools

Before starting development, ensure that you have the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher installed
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Ethereum RPC provider (such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/))
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/s3/) or S3-compatible storage (such as [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces))

### Step 2 - Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wired-labs/wired.git
cd wired
```

### Step 3 - Update environment variables

:::warning

Keep your secrets safe, do not commit them to the repository. You can copy the `.env` file to `.env.local` and update the variables there.

:::

```bash
# Create .env.local
cp apps/client/.env apps/client/.env.local
```

|         Variable         |                               Description                                |

|      MYSQL_PASSWORD      |                          Database user password                          |
|   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD    |                       Database root user password                        |

|       DATABASE_URL       |                         Database connection URI                          |
|     NEXTAUTH_SECRET      | [NextAuth secret](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret) |
|       NEXTAUTH_URL       |                           Client app endpoint                            |
|     S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID     |                              AWS S3 key ID                               |
|        S3_BUCKET         |                            AWS S3 bucket name                            |
|       S3_ENDPOINT        |                          AWS S3 source endpoint                          |

### Step 4 - Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## üìù Branch Management

Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system, create `dev` branches and `main` branches. Developers work on `dev` branches and initiate merge requests to the main branch after completing tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Building

```bash
# Run the apps in development mode
yarn docker:dev
```

The client is hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the documentation at [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).
